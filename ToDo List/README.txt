IDE Used:Pycharm
1) In this task, we will create a simple to-do list application using Python Tkinter that will help users to organize their short notes, messages, or tasks.
2) Listbox: We will be using Python Tkinter Listbox to show multiple tasks stacked one after another. And tasks can be selected when clicked on it.
3) Buttons: We will add two button widgets on the window. One is to add more tasks in Listbox and the other is to delete tasks from Listbox.
4) Entry box: Users will type the task in the entry box which further will be displayed in the Listbox.
5) Messagebox: The Python Tkinter message box is used to display an error message when the user clicks on the add button with an empty entry box.
